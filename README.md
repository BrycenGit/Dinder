## Description

_Dinder is an app to make selecting a place to dine with friends fun and easy!_ 

_How does it work?_
A user selects friends to invite out to eat. Friends and user are sent a dinder--a list of nearby restaurants generated from the Zomato API. Users swipe right or left depending on whether they want to eat at that restaurant or not. After swiping out their preferences, the application returns a matched restaurants.
